Pseudo code for first program

1 Data structure (Two queues)

Q1 Q2

2 Operation

:PUSH(x) To add an element x to the stack:

CODE = 

Push(x):
     Enqueue x into q2
     while q1 is not empty:
         dequeue from q1 and enqueue into q2
     swap q1 and q2

: Pop() To remove the top element of the stack:

CODE =

Pop():
     If q1 is empty:
          print "stack underflow"
          return
       dequeue the front element from q1

Top() To get the top elment of the stack:

CODE =

Top():
       if q1 is empty:
         print "stack is empty"
         return -1
        return the front element of q1

Empty()  To check if the stack is empty

CODE =

Empty():
       return (q1 is empty)
